:description: Elevate your DDD implementation with this tutorial on a Java library that blends Aggregates & functional programming. Gain hands-on expertise now!

Unlock the full potential of Domain Driven Design implementation with this step-by-step tutorial focusing on `faggregate` that blends Aggregates and functional programming.
This library provides developers with a powerful tool to simplify complex development tasks, and this tutorial will give you the hands-on experience and insights you need to effectively utilize its capabilities.
Whether you're a seasoned Java developer or just starting out, this tutorial is the perfect resource for anyone looking to take their DDD implementation to the next level.

== Introduction

`faggregate` is a Java library helping to define Aggregate according to the _Domain Driven Design_ approach with a touch of _Functional Programming_. The source code of `faggregate` is available on link:https://github.com/tmorin/faggregate[github.com/tmorin/faggregate].

By combining the strengths of Domain Driven Design Aggregates and functional programming, developers can achieve a powerful and streamlined development process.
Domain Driven Design Aggregates provide a clear structure for managing complex business entities and enforcing transactional consistency, while functional programming promotes a declarative style of programming, making code easier to understand and maintain.
Together, these approaches lead to more predictable and reliable code, with a reduced likelihood of bugs and easier maintenance.
Additionally, the functional programming paradigm supports code modularity and easy refactoring, making it a great fit for large-scale software development projects.
Put simply, developers can build maintainable and scalable systems that effectively meet the demands of their business domain.

== The scope

The purpose of this tutorial is to build from scratch the `Counter` aggregate.
As its name suggests, the `Counter` aggregate is capable of tracking a value that is incremented.
The counter is incremented when the `CounterIncremented` domain event is produced.
The event is produced when the `IncrementCounter` command is invoked.

.Modeling of the `IncrementCounter` command
[plantuml,target=es_increment,format=svg]
....
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmorin/plantuml-libs/master/distribution/eventstorming/single.puml
Aggregate('Counter')
Command('IncrementCounter')
DomainEvent('CounterIncremented')
IncrementCounter .. Counter : 1. invoked on
IncrementCounter -r-> CounterIncremented : 2. produces
CounterIncremented .. Counter : 3. applied on
....

The source code of the tutorial is available on link:https://github.com/tmorin/faggregate/tree/main/examples/tutorial[github].

== The Maven module

The Maven module brings four dependencies.
The first one, `faggregate-core-simple`, brings the `faggregate` library.
The second one, link:https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/[`junit-jupiter`], provides a test framework.
Finally, link:https://projectlombok.org/[`lombok`], _spices_ up java helping to save lines of codes.

== The Aggregate

The implementation of the Aggregate starts with the structural elements:

- *Entity*: it's an object within the system that has a unique identity and attributes that describe its state.
An entity's identity is typically represented by an ID or a key, and its state changes over time as it participates in the system's interactions.
- *Command*: it's a request for the system to perform a specific action.
Commands are often used to initiate changes in the state of the system.
- *Domain Event*: it's a record of something that has occurred within the system.
Domain events are used to capture the state changes that occur as a result of processing commands.

=== The Root Aggregate

A Root Aggregate is a cluster of related entities that are treated as a single unit with respect to transactions and consistency.
The root aggregate defines a boundary around a set of related entities, and it is responsible for ensuring that changes to its entities are made in a consistent and valid state.

In this tutorial, the Root Aggregate of the `Counter` Aggregate, is the `Counter` Entity.
Usually, a Root Aggregate is an Entity which is mutable.
However, `faggregate` emphasizes a functional approach, therefore the Root Aggregate is an immutable structure.

The Root Aggregate is covered by the following unit test.

[source,java,title=src/test/java/faggregate/tutorial/CounterTest.java]
----
include::../../src/test/java/faggregate/tutorial/CounterTest.java[]

=== The Command

The `IncrementCounter` Command transfers the intention to increment the counter.

include::../../src/main/java/faggregate/tutorial/IncrementCounter.java[]
----

=== The Domain Event

The `CounterChanged` Domain Event states the value of a counter has been changed.

[source,java,title=src/main/java/faggregate/tutorial/CounterChanged.java]
----
include::../../src/main/java/faggregate/tutorial/CounterChanged.java[]
----

== The Command Handler

A Command Handler is a pure function which executes a Command according to the latest known state of an Aggregate.
A Command Handler returns a Result which will be sent back to the initiator of the command as well as a set of Domain Events explaining the outcome of the Command execution.

.Input and output of a command handler
[plantuml,target=obj_command_handler,format=svg]
....
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmorin/plantuml-libs/master/distribution/eventstorming/single.puml
rectangle "command" as command
rectangle "result" as result
rectangle "domain events" as domain_events
rectangle "aggregate state" as aggregate
rectangle "command handler" as command_handler
command --> command_handler
aggregate --> command_handler
command_handler --> result
command_handler --> domain_events
....

The `IncrementCounterHandler` Command Handler handles the `IncrementCounter` Command and produces the `CounterChanged` Domain Event based on the latest known state of the `Counter` Aggregate.

[source,java,title=src/main/java/faggregate/tutorial/IncrementCounterHandler.java]

----
include::../../src/test/java/faggregate/tutorial/IncrementCounterHandlerTest.java[]
----

== The Mutator

A Mutator is a pure function which mutates the state of an Aggregate according to a Domain Event.
A Mutator returns a new instance of the Aggregate state.

.Input and output of a mutator
[plantuml,target=obj_mutator,format=svg]
....
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmorin/plantuml-libs/master/distribution/eventstorming/single.puml
rectangle "domain event" as domain_event
rectangle "aggregate state" as aggregate
rectangle "new aggregate state" as new_aggregate
rectangle "mutator" as mutator
domain_event --> mutator
aggregate --> mutator
mutator --> new_aggregate
....

The `CounterChangedMutator` Mutator mutates the state of the `Counter` Aggregate according to the `CounterChangedMutator` Domain Event.

== The Repository

In this tutorial the Repository is responsible to apply the `faggregate` side effects

- *initializer*: it initializes the state of an Aggregate
- *loader*: it loads the latest known state of an Aggregate
- *persister*: it persists the latest known state and/or the generated Domain Events of an Aggregate
- *destroyer*: it destroys the persisted data related to an Aggregate

The default implementation of `faggregate`, i.e. `faggregate-core-simple`, expects the definition of all side effects when an Aggregate Manager is configured.
Therefore, the tutorial implements and registers all side effects even if only the *loader* and *persister* side effects are involved.

=== The Initializer

An initializer is executed when the type of the handled Command has been registered with the `INITIALIZATION` intention.

.Input and output of an initializer
[plantuml,target=obj_initializer,format=svg]
....
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmorin/plantuml-libs/master/distribution/eventstorming/single.puml
rectangle "aggregate identifier" as aggregate_identifier
rectangle "command" as command
rectangle "aggregate state" as aggregate
rectangle "initializer" as initializer
aggregate_identifier --> initializer
command --> initializer
initializer --> aggregate
....

=== The Loader

A loader is executed when the type of the handled Command has been registered with the `MUTATION` intention.

.Input and output of a loader
[plantuml,target=obj_loader,format=svg]
....
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmorin/plantuml-libs/master/distribution/eventstorming/single.puml
rectangle "aggregate identifier" as aggregate_identifier
rectangle "aggregate state" as aggregate
rectangle "loader" as loader
aggregate_identifier --> loader
loader --> aggregate
....

=== The Persister

A persister is executed when the type of the handled Command has been registered with the `INITIALIZATION` or `MUTATION` intentions.

.Input and output of a persister
[plantuml,target=obj_persister,format=svg]
....
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmorin/plantuml-libs/master/distribution/eventstorming/single.puml
rectangle "aggregate identifier" as aggregate_identifier
rectangle "aggregate state" as aggregate
rectangle "persister" as persister
rectangle "domain events" as events
aggregate_identifier --> persister
aggregate --> persister
events --> persister
....

=== The Destroyer

A destroyer is executed when the type of the handled command has been registered with the `DESTRUCTION` intention.

.Input and output of a destroyer
[plantuml,target=obj_destroyer,format=svg]
....
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tmorin/plantuml-libs/master/distribution/eventstorming/single.puml
rectangle "aggregate identifier" as aggregate_identifier
rectangle "aggregate state" as aggregate
rectangle "domain events" as events
rectangle "destroyer" as destroyer
aggregate_identifier --> destroyer
aggregate --> destroyer
events --> destroyer
....

=== The implementation

[source,java,title=src/main/java/faggregate/tutorial/CounterRepository.java]
----
include::../../src/main/java/faggregate/tutorial/CounterRepository.java[]

The Repository is covered by the following unit test.

[source,java,title=src/test/java/faggregate/tutorial/CounterRepositoryTest.java]
----
include::../../src/test/java/faggregate/tutorial/CounterRepositoryTest.java[]
----

== The Configurer

A Configurer binds the handlers, mutators and all side effects of an Aggregate.
For ease, there is only one Configurer of the Counter Aggregate.
In fact, in production grade project, there is Configured for the core domain and also ones in infrastructure,
e.g. one for a relational database, another one for an in memory storage ....
